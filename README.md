Title: Cyclones and Capital: Market Reactions to Tropical Cyclones in India

This study analyzes the short-term impact of tropical cyclones on Indian equity and derivatives markets using a multi-method event study approach. Drawing on 15 years of data (2008–2023), we examine the response of Nifty 50 constituents and sectoral indices to major cyclonic events in the Bay of Bengal. Abnormal returns (AR) and cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) are computed around ±5-day event windows, supported by t-tests and non-parametric validations. Volatility is modeled via GARCH(1,1), and Granger causality tests are employed to evaluate the directional influence of cyclone occurrences on return anomalies. Additionally, anomaly detection using Isolation Forest supports the identification of cyclonic financial shocks. Our findings reveal statistically significant, sector-specific responses—particularly in infrastructure, logistics, and utilities—despite limited movement in broad indices. These results challenge the null hypothesis and offer implications for climate-adjusted investment strategies in emerging markets.

Natural disasters pose a growing threat to global economic stability, with financial markets often reacting to environmental disruptions through volatility, re-pricing, and
capital flight. In developed markets, event studies have documented how hurricanes, earthquakes, and pandemics impact stock prices and sectoral returns. However,limited attention has been paid to emerging markets like India, where climatic risks are intensifying, yet financial resilience remains under-researched. India’s eastern coast, particularly the Bay of Bengal region, is frequently affected by tropical cyclones that disrupt transport, energy supply chains, agriculture, and public infrastructure. These disruptions can cascade into financial markets through reduced earnings expectations, operational halts, and investor sentiment shifts. Despite this, it remains unclear whether Indian capital markets efficiently price in such exogenous shocks.

This paper investigates the short-term impact of tropical cyclones on Indian stock and derivatives markets, testing the null hypothesis that these events do not lead to abnormal financial behavior. Using a 15-year dataset of major cyclonic events and a multi-method framework—including event study methodology, GARCH volatility modeling, and Granger causality testing—we examine abnormal return behavior across sectors and time windows. The study contributes to the growing literature on climate finance by offering empirical insights into the market’s sensitivity to climate-linked disasters in a major emerging economy.

Bringing these dimensions together reveals complementary insights and gaps.At the national level, country-specific studies tend to use event- or dummy-based models: the Australian ARIMA work directly quantifies cyclone shocks on returns, and the Indian event-study captures landslide news effects. These models assume a direct “impact” window and measure abnormal returns. By contrast, cross-country studies (Lee et al.) focus on spillovers, using volatility and correlation methods to detect contagion among markets. Few studies combine both approaches; for example, one could imagine modelling India’s cyclone impact not only by a local event dummy but also by co-movements with adjacent markets. Sectoral analyses add another layer: Giraldo’s study of U.S. markets systematically compares sector indices and even proposes trading strategies post-disaster. No analogous sector analysis exists for India. Thus, a blended approach could link methods to themes: e.g. using ARIMA or EGARCH to capture market-wide volatility around a cyclone, while also running firm-level event studies for affected industries. Moreover, the international literature underscores that information diffusion matters – markets react as news (and relief efforts) unfold. Our study of Indian cyclones can build on this by examining how quickly and through which channels cyclone news is incorporated into Indian stock prices and derivatives, filling the noted gap in an otherwise global body of evidence. Overall, the literature confirms that disasters often depress equity returns in the short run (especially when damage is large), but also that markets tend to recover as uncertainty resolves (consistent with market efficiency). By combining thematic findings (e.g. cyclone effects observed abroad) with these methodological lessons (event studies plus contagion tests), our research will contribute an integrated perspective: it will quantify the immediate impact of Indian tropical cyclones on stocks and derivatives (using event-study and time-series models) and assess whether these shocks spill over to or from other markets. This addresses the clear gap that, despite many studies of earthquakes and hurricanes, the specific case of Indian cyclones has not yet been examined. The new analysis thus builds on prior contributions while targeting the unique context of India’s market response to cyclonic disasters.
